# AvatarComponents
<br>
A continued "Work In Progress" of Avatar Components for Unity. It's not perfect, but it's getting there. :-D  Starting with the first Module:
<br>
<h2>Simulated Eye Tracking - version 0.1 </h2> 
<br>
<p>What started a prototype for [BigscreenVR](http://www.bigscreenvr.com) has slowly grown and refined for broader use cases and capabilities. Just add the Manager_EyeGaze component to your character.</p>

Eye contact is a subtle, yet powerful effect.

If you're tired of characters and avatars with that dead look in their eyes, look no further! Here is a simple library of Unity scripts that bring life to the eyes of your characters. Add a simple component to objects that are "interesting" and designate their most interesting points, and the character will <b>not</b> simply stare at them, but continuosly scan them from point-to-point as if they were actually interested in them.
